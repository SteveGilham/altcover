# Monitor.TryGetVisitTotals method

Try to get the total visited points

```csharp
public static bool TryGetVisitTotals(out PointCount totals)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| totals | The visited point counts if running under AltCover coverage |

## Return Value

True if running under AltCover coverage

## Remarks

Current implementation requires `dotnet test`, or other command-line testing with `--eager` NOT set, in which the cumulative visit numbers are available, rather than everything having been dumped to file instead.
