                                   A single digit 0-7 gives the number of
                               decimal places of seconds to report; everything
                               else is at the mercy of the system clock

                               an attribute type name (the trailing "Attribute"
                               is optional), so [Test] or [TestAttribute] will
                               match; if the name contains one or more ".",
                               then it will be matched against the full name of
                               the attribute type.

                               names (fully qualified if the string contains

      --branchcover          Optional: Do not record line coverage.  Ignored
                               for the --reportFormat=NCover option.

      --showstatic[=VALUE]   Optional: Instrument and show code that is by
                               default skipped as trivial.  --showstatic:- is

                               showstatic or --showstatic:+ sets the unvisited
                               count to a negative value interpreted by the
                               visualizer (but treated as zero by
                               ReportGenerator) ; --showstatic:++ sets the

      --verbose              Optional, multiple: Verbose mode -- once to switch
                               on detailed messages (or undo one level of -q if
