# Previously

# 6.8.761  (Fukurou series release 13)
* Final 6.x release, barring serious bug-fixes
* Deprecate the `dotnet-altcover` DotNetCliToolReference Tool, package `altcover.dotnet`, prior to removal in the v7.0.xxx release.  See https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3115 for context
* Move delivered code to all new-style projects, and all supporting projects except where the old style is explicitly required
* [BUGFIX] Accept the OpenCover format variant generated by `coverlet` for PowerShell and, FWIW, the Visualizer.
* [BUGFIX] Provide a suitable binary (a simple shim called `AltCover.NetCoreApp.dll`) in the API nupkg for `AltCover.Fake.Api.toolPath AltCover.Fake.Implementation.DotNetCore` to return -- and test that it works, just like the build already tested `AltCover.Fake.Api.toolPath AltCover.Fake.Implementation.Framework`
* Ignore constructors for `[<Sealed; AbstractClass>]` types in F# for the purposes of coverage
* [API] `AltCover.CoverageFormats.PostProcess` to take an existing OpenCover format document and fill in the derived quantities e.g. `<Summary>` elements, sequence point branch visits, etc.
* [API] `AltCover.CoverageFormats.FormatFromCoverlet` to patch up the most obvious parts missing from `coverlet`'s dialect of the OpenCover format e.g. start and end columns, npath complexity, etc. as well as all the `PostProcess` features. Also reified as the cmdlet `Format-FromCoverletOpenCover`
---
# 6.7.750  (Fukurou series release 12)
* [PowerShell] Improve the `ConvertTo-BarChart`  cmdlet following the Visualizer-focussed enhancements in the previous release
* [PowerShell] Add `-WhatIf` capability to `Invoke-AltCover` for prepare and collect operations (syntax permitted, but meaningless for `-Version`)
* [PowerShell] Make the `Invoke-AltCover -ShowStatic` parameter take a typesafe enum (as well as untyped strings); a backwards compatible API extension.
* [Visualizer] new `--schemadir[=path]` command-line parameter to set or clear an application-level `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` value
* [API] `PrepareParams.WhatIf : unit -> FSApi.ValidatedCommandLine`; and `CollectParams.WhatIf : bool -> FSApi.ValidatedCommandLine` to do read-only parameter validation and command line composition
* [API] The equivalent `public FSApi.ValidatedCommandLine PrepareArgs.WhatIf()` and `public FSApi.ValidatedCommandLine CollectArgs.WhatIf(bool afterPreparation)` for the CSApi types
---
# 6.6.747  (Fukurou series release 11)
* [API, Fake Helper API] Deprecate the `DotNet.TestOptions.WithImportModule` and `.WithGetVersion` extension methods in favour of the otherwise identical `DotNet.TestOptions.WithAltCoverImportModule` and `.WithAltCoverGetVersion`; the obsolete name now just calls through to the preferred one.
* [API] `--showstatic[:[-|+|++]]` (string `ShowStatic` default "-" in API, `-ShowStatic string` PowerShell) to reveal the code usually auto-filtered (e.g. auto-properties, some system generated types, structure comparison methods in F#...); either with coverage value `-3` (option '+') which is highlighted in the Visualizer but treated as 0 by [ReportGenerator](https://danielpalme.github.io/ReportGenerator/), or the value '0' (option '++')
* [API] `--showGenerated` (bool `ShowGenerated` default false in API, `-ShowGenerated` PowerShell) to reveal the code marked by [CompilerGenerated] or [GeneratedCode] with coverage value `-2`which is highlighted in the Visualizer but treated as 0 by [ReportGenerator](https://danielpalme.github.io/ReportGenerator/)
* [Visualizer, BUGFIX] fix the sorting of method by name for NCover format
* [Visualizer] group property `get_` and `set_`, and event `add_` and `remove_`,  methods together, under an appropriate icon
* [Visualizer] For F# modules containing only types, group the contents together under a module entry at class level, just as they would have been were the module to directly contain any functions
* [Visualizer] Types that only contain an `Invoke` method and constructors are shown with an approriate icon, too.
* [3rd Party] With the latest GTK#3 update, the GTK+ native libraries for win-x64 are no longer bundled into the nuget -- this seems to have been a transient behaviour in GtkSharp v3.22.25.49 only
---
# 6.5.739  (Fukurou series release 10)
* [Command-line and CLI tool] Rolling forwards with `runtimeconfig.template.json` -- it's not just for global tools : make all the executables .net core 3+ compatible.
  * this now packages the GTK# assemblies, and GTK+ native libraries for win-x64, for the .net core visualizer
  * also enable the build to execute on hosts with nothing before .net core 3 runtime
* [API, Fake Helper API] Deprecate the `DotNet.TestOptions.WithParameters` extension method in favour of the otherwise identical `DotNet.TestOptions.WithAltCoverParameters`; the obsolete name now just calls through to the preferred one.
* [Visualizer tool] Update GTK# for .net Core
* [BUGFIX] In `ConvertFrom-NCover`, don't add classes for which there is no method coverage data.  This mainly affects system generated classes implementation details, including ones actually called `<PrivateImplementationDetails$...>...`
* In cobertura format output, including the `ConvertTo-Cobertura` cmdlet, truncate rates to 2 decimal places (equivalent to integral percentages used elsewhere)
---
# 6.4.734 (Fukurou series release 9)
* [FAKE Helper API] Fake >= 5.18.1 is required for this release (the work-round for FAKE issue #2412 has been removed)
* [FAKE Helper API] Add this constraint as an explicit dependency
* [API] Add `Tool of String` a literal alongside `FilePath of String`, which is expanded to a full path to `TypeSafe.FilePath`
* [API] Add `IncludeItem of Regex` which represents a `?`-prefix regex string to `TypeSafe.FilterItem`
* Trap and log exceptions reported in Issue #71 as files `<coverage report path>.<timestamp>.exn`
* Other housekeeping
---
# 6.3.729 (Fukurou series release 8)
* Filter out assemblies without the `ILOnly` bit set (i.e. pretty much anything C++/CLI, even with the deprecated /clr:pure compiler flag set)
* [FAKE Helper API] Fake >= 5.18.0 is required for this release
* [FAKE Helper API] Deprecate `AltCover_Fake.DotNet.Testing.AltCover.ToolType` in favour of `Fake.DotNet.ToolType` in the `AltCover_Fake.DotNet.Testing.AltCover.Params` record structure.  
* [FAKE Helper API] Helper functions in `AltCover_Fake.DotNet.Testing.AltCover`
  * `splitCommandLine: string -> string list` for breaking up composed command lines e.g. from `Fake.DotNet.Testing.NUnit3.buildArgs` or `Fake.DotNet.Testing.XUnit2.buildArgs`
  * `buildDotNetTestCommandLine: (DotNet.TestOptions -> DotNet.TestOptions) -> string -> (string * string list)` taking the arguments for `DotNet.test` and returning the `dotnet` path and the rest of the command line
  * `runWithMono: string option -> Params -> 'a` to execute the `Params` using the path to the Mono executable if it's a FAKE-style full framework tool on Windows (equivalent to the deprecated `AltCover.ToolType.Mono`)
  * `Params.WithToolType: Fake.DotNet.ToolType -> Params` Setting the new tool type using this member is the preferred forward-compatible way to do this
---
# 6.2.727 (Fukurou series release 7 respin)
* [BUGFIX] Issue #74 -- Strip unwanted dependencies from released code.
* Generally, move to .net core 3.0 for build (many other changes in process only)
  * In .net core 3.0 release, `dotnet build` no longer does a `dotnet publish` to the output directory
  * With the F# 4.7 compiler, static linking FSharp.Core into the recorder has been fixed, and has been adopted
  * Issues #68 and #73 and their fixes are now moot; in particular, `FSharp.Core` no longer needs to be auto-excluded from instrumentation in the .net core tool any more than in the Framework tool; nor does that assembly need to be copied if otherwise absent.

# 6.2.719 (Fukurou series release 6)
* [BUGFIX] #Issue73 In .net core 3.0 preview and RC, `dotnet build` does a `dotnet publish` to the output directory, including FSharp.Core in F# projects.  Automatically exclude that file from instrumentation by the .net core tool to avoid mutually recursive calls between the recorder assembly and FSharp.Core that cause a stack overflow.  This  is not required for the Framework/Mono tool as that static links its dependency. I've not found a way to static-link FSharp.Core in the .net core world that doesn't fail with errors.
* [BUGFIX] For --visibleBranches, fix up C# loops, and the path numbering for decompiled `switch`/`match` logic

# 6.2.714 (Fukurou series release 5)
* [BUGFIX] Finish wiring up `/p:AltCoverLocalSource` support
* [BUGFIX] Fix failure when input/output directories were specified with a trailing separator character
* [HACK] mitigate Issue #71 by simply ignoring null module identifiers.
* [API] `-v|--visibleBranches` option (bool `VisibleBranches` default false in API, `-VisibleBranches` PowerShell flag) to simplify the reporting of `switch` or `match` cases where the compiler produces a tangle of `if`/`else` branches that give surprising results in a `ReportGenerator` output (e.g. `null` taking a different branch to a `default` case than a non-`null` value as per Issue 72)
* Use a leading `?` as a negator for filter matches e.g. `?(a|b)` means "exclude anything that doesn't match a or match b", or `?MyApp` means exclude anything that doesn't contain `MyApp`; no valid .net regex begins with this so it's backwards compatible.  Between this and the previous release's `--localSource` (now fully supported) option, the need to resort to cumbersome constructs involving negative lookahead regexes should be reduced.
---
# 6.1.708 (Fukurou series release 4)
* [BUGFIX] reinstate the PowerShell Core (`pwsh`) `Invoke-AltCover` support for strongnaming.
* [API] `-l|--localSource` option (bool `LocalSource` default false in API, `-LocalSource` PowerShell flag) to ignore .pdb files that refer to source files not present on the current computer (test is if the first file found exists or not, and assumes that this is all-or-nothing, and assume no coincidences in naming).
---
# 6.0.705 (Fukurou series release 3)
* [BUGFIX] in the case of multiple output folders, properly weave the AltCover recorder assembly dependency into all `dotnet` projects, not just the first.
* [BUGFIX] when using the `dotnet` version of the tools, and when a suitable FSharp.Core package is present in the nuget cache, it is not necessary to copy one from the AltCover deployment to the output folder for a `dotnet` project
* [BUGFIX] create the directory to hold the report file if it does not already exists
* Use Mono.Cecil 0.11 for strongnaming in `dotnet`, removing the local reimplementation of assembly writing with strongnaming.

# 6.0.700 (Fukurou series release 2)
* [BUGFIX] in `dotnet test` the pipe character `|` is used as a separator because the previous choice of `;` didn't play nice with MSBuild.  To escape pipe characters inside regular expressions, double them up `||`.  See the [Usage](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/Usage) and [`dotnet test`](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/%60dotnet-test%60-integration) wiki pages for more detail.

# 6.0.698 (Fukurou series release 1)
* [BREAKING] Allow multiple input and output directories for instrumentation into a single report.  This changes the types in API structures from `string` to `string seq` (F#) or `string[]` (C#) where appropriate.  Use case : [instrument multiple unit test assemblies in one go](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/blob/9f6ed07e9d5d1c35d8c99a589fb77fe1868cecab/Build/targets.fsx#L702-L703) for running as [a single test step](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/blob/9f6ed07e9d5d1c35d8c99a589fb77fe1868cecab/Build/targets.fsx#L724-L726) to collect coverage.
* Enable the `--sn` and `-k` arguments in the `dotnet` build.  This doesn't change any APIs, but it does mean that these arguments are no longer ignored for the .net core platform.  This work borrows from changes recently made in Mono.Cecil but not yet in a release build; in the fullness of time, my roll-my-own support will be replaced with the real deal.
* For what it's worth, enable the `-d` argument in the .net framework/Mono build (as the APIs already exposed this, the change is behavioural -- any values supplied are used rather than silently dropped)
---
# 5.3.688 (Ezoguma series release 8)
* [BUGFIX] Branch-chasing could enter an infinite loop burning memory as it went by ignoring instructions that would exit that loop (e.g. return, throw, break)
* Updating consumed libraries and related changes to build process (no functional differences)

# 5.3.679 (Ezoguma series release 7)
* Add the search of the .net core nuget cache into the Framework/Mono build to address issue 20 corner case
* Minor change to usage text for `-o` option to refer to `--inplace`
* On Windows Terminal 0.2.x, the default foreground is ConsoleColor.Gray, and ConsoleColor.White can have the same RGB values as the default background hue ConsoleColor.Black (e.g. the supplied Solarized Light), so don't set the colour to White, but use Foreground instead.
* Use locale-independent string-to-number interconversion in the calculation of CRAP score
* Package `AltCover.exe.config` for the .net framework build, and add `README.html` to the packages that lacked it.
* Updating consumed libraries and related changes to build process (no functional differences)

# 5.3.675 (Ezoguma series release 6)
* In the `Invoke-AltCover -Runner` cmdlet, send the summary text (OpenCover and/or TeamCity style) to the object pipeline as well as to the `Information` channel.
* Option `--defer[:[+|-]]` (default `--defer:-`) (`-Defer` for PowerShell; Defer property on MSBuild task; API field) to keep all the visit data in memory and only write the total out during process exit
* Automatic defer, with in-process data collection, for `dotnet test` to work around the 100ms limitation on `ProcessExit` handling imposed by the VSTest system that led to the "write everything to disk" runner mode in the first place
* Other throughput improvements for data collection
---
# 5.2.667 (Ezoguma series release 5)
* [BUGFIX] Expose the sourcelink functionality through `dotnet test` as well (`/p:AltCoverSourceLink=true`)
* [BUGFIX] Update help text to current
* [BUGFIX] Fix the long-standing case where two or more branches of a switch go to the same location so that all of them go through the instrumentation
* `/p:AltCoverShowSummary=colour` to echo summary data to stdout in the colour of choice (default: current foreground if `colour` is not a valid `ConsoleColor` case-insensitive name e.g. `"true"`), and equivalent API extensions
* `--teamcity[]:[+][R|B]]` to put an additional (`+`) or replacement teamcity summary, with branches as teamcity branches with `R` or blocks `B` (which. last I tried, was the value to actually show up in the build report); if no optionas are attached, `B` is understood.  Exposed via API field `SummaryFormat`, PowerShell `-SummaryFormat`, `dotnet test` argument `/p:AltCoverSummaryFormat=...`
---
# 5.1.666 (Ezoguma series release 4)
* `--dropReturnCode` ( `-DropReturnCode` in PowerShell, `ExposeReturnCode` with default value `true` in the Fake API) to not pass the return code of any nested process
* `--sourcelink` to give the source link URL for tracked files rather than the file path (untracked files still have the local file path)
* Visualizer support for sourcelink URLs
* Generate Cobertura to the v4 DTD [http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/xml/coverage-04.dtd](https://github.com/cobertura/cobertura/blob/master/cobertura/src/site/htdocs/xml/coverage-04.dtd)
---
# 5.0.665 (Ezoguma series release 3)
* [BUGFIX] Restore visualizer support for OpenCover format (internal consistency check failure)
* [BUGFIX] Issue #52 -- fix OpenCover, LCov and Cobertura format output in the case of exclusion by path
* [BUGFIX] Issue #50 -- take Cecil 0.10.3 with the actual fix in it
* Some improvements to the throughput of coverage data, reducing time taken by the instrumented self-tests.

# 5.0.664 (Ezoguma series release 2)
* [BUGFIX] Issue #49 -- `dotnet test` integration : internally, escape the `'\'` character, which is  is helpfully treated by MSBuild as a path separator and flipped to be `'/'` on non-Windows platforms when introduced through `/p:AltCover*Filter` arguments.
* [BUGFIX] Issue #48 -- fix embedded-PDB detection to avoid false positives
* Updating consumed libraries and related changes.

# 5.0.663 (Ezoguma series release 1)
Bringing gifts, as is appropriate for the season
* [BUGFIX] Issue #46 -- handle the case of a left-behind `__Saved` directories by failing in a more obvious fashion (and offering a `/p:AltCoverForce=true` option to force-delete such a directory)
* Support instrumenting assemblies with embedded PDBs
  * [BREAKING] the `XUnit` assemblies have embedded PDBs, so will suddenly be caught up in instrumentation without a `-e xunit` or equivalent to exclude them
* [BREAKING] Complete API overhaul to properly address known problems and to try to future-proof everything against any similar issues -- see the Wiki [here for in-process execution](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/The-AltCover-API,-plus-Fake-and-Cake-integration) and [here for FAKE scripting](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/The-AltCover.Fake-package)
---
# 4.0.661 (Doruka series release 11)
* [BUGFIX] More forms of Issue #43 related to `yield return` synthetic methods.
* [BUGFIX] Issue #45 by re-working the static linkage of the recorder assembly using `ILMerge /internalise` (rather than `--standalone`).
* Updating consumed libraries and related changes.

# 4.0.660 (Doruka series release 10)
* [BUGFIX] Issue #43 Detect and skip simple recursive references when looking from a synthetic method to its containing method
* [Enhancement] Follow the Fake build system to use [`BlackFox.CommandLine`](https://github.com/vbfox/FoxSharp/tree/master/src/BlackFox.CommandLine) facilities to compose command lines with proper re-escaping/enquoting of items read from the command line following a `--`
* [BUGFIX] [API] A single string for a command line as in `AltCover.PrepareParams.CommandLine` would not work for anything more than a parameterless invocation.
  * Add new field `Command` to the F# & C# parameter APIs and to the MSBuild task taking an array or sequence of strings
  * Deprecate the `CommandLine` field (at compile time for C# API and MSBuild; warning at runtime for F#, because it's not possible to usefully mark a record field as [<Obsolete>])
  * In the cases where the deprecated `CommandLine` field is used (non-empty with the preferred `.Command` field being empty), use the operating-system specific facilities in `BlackFox.CommandLine` to decompose the string so as to separate out the executable from its arguments)
  * Expect a thorough and breaking rework in the next major version (5.0) release
* [BUGFIX] If an error is raised during instrumentation, then a message is logged saying that the exception details have been written to a file in the nominated output directory (for `--inplace` operations, this is where the unaltered binaries are saved off to).  If this happens during `dotnet test`, the tidy-up action actually moves everything from that directory back into the original location and deletes the output directory, moving the log file too.  If the operation could be `dotnet test`, then amend the message appropriately to say that the file may have been moved.
* Minor improvements to error handling in the Visualizer
* Minor improvements to the fix for issue #41

# 4.0.659 (Doruka series release 9)
* [BUGFIX] Issue #42 Remove the need for process-exit handling to rely on non-event-handler threads being scheduled, so allowing the coverage data to be flushed to disk, even on low-spec platforms like Raspberry Pi
* [BUGFIX] Issue #41 Reduce memory use in processing coverage data (runner mode/`dotnet test` scenarios)
* [BUGFIX] Exclusion by attribute now works for property-level attributes, and will exclude the getter and/or setter (if not already excluded)
* Various build process improvements/updates

# 4.0.655 (Doruka series release 8)
* [NEW PACKAGE] `altcover.fake` containing just helper types for FAKE scripts (v5.9.3 or later) : see Wiki entry [The `AltCover.Fake` package](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/The-AltCover.Fake-package)
  * Module `AltCover_Fake.DotNet.Testing.AltCover` containing an `AltCover` task for driving any command-line version of AltCover, along with helper types
  * Module `AltCover_Fake.DotNet.DotNet` fluent extension methods for `Fake.DotNet.DotNet.TestOptions` using the `AltCover_Fake.DotNet...` helper types
  * dog-food these features in the AltCover build process
* [API] -- `AltCover.Api.CollectParams`
  * Make `[<NoComparison>]` explicit
  * Mark the `Default` member `[<Obsolete>]`; prefer new `Create()` instead
* [API] -- `AltCover.Api.PrepareParams`
  * Make `[<NoComparison>]` explicit
  * All `string array` members have been relaxed to become `string seq`
  * Mark the `Default` member `[<Obsolete>]`; prefer new `Create()` instead
* [API] -- `AltCover.Fake.Api`
  * `static member toolPath` for finding the location of an AltCover command-line executable in the same nuget package
* [API] -- `AltCover.Fake.DotNet`
  * Extend module with more `Fake.DotNet.DotNet.TestOptions` fluent extension methods `WithImportModule()` and `WithGetVersion()`

# 4.0.653 (Doruka series release 7)
* Properly resolve the strong-naming of the recorder assembly (a fix for Issue #38 closer to the original intent, compared with the "just-make-it-work" fix in 4.0.649)
* Look for dependencies -- mostly ASP .net Core assemblies -- under `%ProgramFiles%\dotnet\shared` or `/usr/share/dotnet/shared` as well as under `%USERPROFILE%/.nuget/packages`
* Look for dependencies under `%NUGET_PACKAGES%`
* Extend the `-d` argument parser to expand environment variables and to handle relative paths

# 4.0.649 (Doruka series release 6)
* [BUGFIX] Issue #37 -- handle release builds of C# `return <ternary>;` expressions which don't look like ternaries in their IL.  Fix some corner cases of NPath complexity, branch exit counts and branch visit counts revealed by these cases.
**NOTE** This form of ternary expression is the first case of a significant user defined branch within a sequence point; the `Compress-Branching -WithinSequencePoint` cmdlet at this release _will_ flatten these constructs.
* [BUGFIX] Accept coverlet's idiosyncratic OpenCover-style output into cmdlet and Visualizer operations -- it uses Boolean.ToString() at points, which generates capitalized `True` and `False` attribute values, which are not valid XSD `boolean`s
* [BUGFIX] Issue #38 -- in some .net framework cases, the strong-naming of the recorder assembly was broken; an approach that testing shows to be more reliable has been used.
* [API] Update to FAKE 5.8.5 and validate support from 5.0 up to current

# 4.0.644 (Doruka series release 5)
* [API] - FAKE 5.7.2 support -- FAKE integration now spans from v5.0 up to current (and should be reasonably future-proofed), and is now also offered on an experimental basis for the .net framework
* various refactorings and rearrangements, some on purely aesthetic grounds, some to improve the reliability of the travis-ci build, but with no functional impact

# 4.0.630 (Doruka series release 4)
* Add SourceLink to the build process (and the .nuspec)
* [BUGFIX] Work around an apparent change in behaviour in mono 5.14 that loses some recorded coverage in runner mode; the problem does not affect .net framework or .net core, but does impact those travis build self-tests that aren't on .net core
* [BUGFIX] Fix localization packaging in .netcore 2.1.4xx
* [BUGFIX] Source scrolling in the global tool version of the visualizer
* [API] Expose all cmdlet functionality as APIs and run the PowerShell cmdlets through the public API
* [Visualizer] add the XML document as a root of the tree view, and the current source file (if any) to the application title bar; clear source pane when new coverage file is selected.

# 4.0.618 (Doruka series release 3)
* [NEW PACKAGE] `altcover.visualizer` containing .net core/GTK3 Visualizer global tool implementation
  * .net core/GTK3 Visualizer also contained in the general-purpose and the API packages for direct `dotnet path/to/AltCover.Visualizer.dll` use
  * needs GTK+3 installed separately -- for Windows, see e.g. https://github.com/GtkSharp/GtkSharp/wiki/Installing-Gtk-on-Windows
* Improved error messages for the GTK# Visualizer
* Improved font handling for the GTK# Visualizer (now it updates immediately)
* [API] strong-name keys can now be meaningfully validated from .net core
* Minor improvements to reliability on mono

# 4.0.603 (Doruka series release 2)
* [BUGFIX] PowerShell and GetVersion tasks might produce empty output in 4.0.600 : now fixed
* [BUGFIX] pack the pwsh support into the API module (omission in 4.0.600)
* [API] Defaults provided for CSApi types `CollectArgs` and `PrepareArgs` equivalent to the F# defaults
* [API] `PrepareParams.Vaildate : unit -> string array`; and `CollectParams.Validate : bool -> string array` to do read-only parameter validation
* [API] The equivalent `public string[] PrepareArgs.Validate()` and `public string[] CollectArgs.Validate(bool afterPreparation)` for the CSApi types

# 4.0.600 (Doruka series release 1)
* [NEW PACKAGE] AltCover.Api exposing the shared API used by both the MSBuild tasks and the PowerShell `Invoke-AltCover` cmdlet, in native F# and with a C#-friendly adapter layer
  * Also included, integrations with Fake ( >= 5.2.0) and Cake ( >= 0.28.0), each in their separate assembly, to avoid any need to drag in unwanted extra dependencies
  * The PowerShell module and the MSBuild tasks
  * And the `dotnet test` integration
* [ALL PACKAGES] `Compress-Branching` cmdlet to transform OpenCover's liberal idea of significant branches towards AltCover's more restricted approach -- chose either or both of `-SameSpan` to unify branches that go from the same start, and take the same trajectory to the same end (OpenCover issue #786 being one instance of this) and `-WithinSequencePoint` to remove branches interior to a statement (compiler generated things like stashing of lambdas, the hidden conditional `Dispose()` after a `using`, or inside F# inlines -- OpenCover issues #657, #807 being instances of this)
* [BUGFIX] Issue # 31 -- In the case of `dotnet test` with multiple target frameworks make the coverage file `name.extension` go to `name.framework.extension`, be it supplied or be it defaulted.
---
# 3.5.587 (Cerulean series release 10)
* [BUGFIX] Issue #29 -- handle strong-named dependencies properly in the .net core case (reinstating code too enthusiatically removed six months earlier)
* [BUGFIX] Issue #29 -- Allow `dotnet test` to usefully specify exclusion filters when building (did not affect `dotnet test --no-build`)
* Refactor in a few places to reduce code duplication 

# 3.5.580 (Cerulean series release 9)
* [NEW] `AltCover.Visualizer` tool for .net framework and mono (for .net framework, needs GTK#2.12.xx installed separately -- see https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)
* `-p|--pathFilter` (`-PathFilter`, `PathFilter="string[]"`, `/p:AltCoverPathFilter=...`) option to specify regexes to select source files to ignore on the basis of their full path; distinct from the `--fileFilter` option which works on the file name alone.  The distinction is that you'd use `-p` to exclude your folder `$(SolutionRoot)Generated`, and `-f` to exclude your `.g.cs` files wherever they are.
* [BUGFIX] Issue #28 --in OpenCover format,  don't emit empty (no `uid=` attribute)`FileRef` tags for methods that aren't being instrumented.
* [BUGFIX] Related degenerate case handling in `ConvertTo-BarChart`, `ConvertTo-LCov` and `ConvertTo-Cobertura` : these operations could fail for some legitimate corner cases found in OpenCover files (fixed in code shared with the Visualizer in the course of Visualizer testing)

# 3.5.569 (Cerulean series release 8)
* `altcover version` command line option to output the version of AltCover being used (also `Invoke-AltCover -Version`, MSBuild task `AltCover.GetVersion`, option `/p:AltCoverGetVersion`)
* `--single` (`-Single`, `Single="bool"`, `/p:AltCoverSingle=true`) option to only sample the first visit to each point (per AppDomain), reducing intermediate file size and processing time.
* `--linecover` (`-LineCover`, `LineCover="bool"`, `/p:AltCoverLineCover=true`) option to only only record line coverage in OpenCover format.
* `--branchcover` (`-BranchCover`, `BranchCover="bool"`, `/p:AltCoverBranchCover=true`) option to only record branch coverage in OpenCover format.

# 3.5.560 (Cerulean series release 7)
* [BUGFIX] -- `dotnet test` integration : don't leave the imported FSharp.Core.dll in the binaries folder
* `dotnet test` integration : Override the "VSTest" target to allow tidying after test failure
* [BUGFIX; BREAKING] -- `ConvertFrom-NCover` : fill in the `<Summary />`, `<Method />`, and `<MethodPoint />` attribute values to reflect the recorded visits.  This uses existing code, and comes at the cost of translating the output to `[xml]` instead of `XDocument`.

# 3.5.556 (Cerulean series release 6)
* [BUGFIX] -- Issue #23 : properly and completely remove strong-names when no new key is supplied ( = always in the .net core build, since Mono.Cecil there doesn't support setting strong-naming keys)

# 3.5.550 (Cerulean series release 5)

* All packages now include the `pwsh` module alongside the main .net core AltCover.dll
* `altcover ipmo` command line option to output the `Import-Module` invocation needed to register the PowerShell module for the version of AltCover being used.  Yes, the path for the global tool does include the name and version twice; that's just how it works.
* `AltCover.PowerShell` MSBuild task and option `/p:AltCoverIpmo=true` to expose this functionality through MSBuild and `dotnet test` integration
* [BUGFIX] messages categorized as warnings now display for the Dotnet-CLI and global tool versions.
* Better format for the throughput feedback (comma groups -- or localized equivalent -- for the big numbers)

### "classic" and dotnet CLI NuGet packages
* Support `dotnet add package ...` for `dotnet test` integration -- now added to dotnet CLI package
* Availability limited because dotnet global tools aren't compatible with `dotnet add package`

### "classic" NuGet package only
* provides the .net Framework/mono binaries, including the Windows PowerShell module

# 3.5.543 (Cerulean series release 4)
### All NuGet packages
* [BUGFIX] -- Issue #22 : Using a custom serialization gives the major speed-up I was looking for, without needing to try tricks that may be counter-productive given the use of compression in the process.
* **NOTE** this breaks compatibility between previously instrumented code and the new runner (and vice versa); in general, only same-version components are supported.
* Indicate the throughput levels in the command line output
### "classic" NuGet package only
* `ConvertTo-BarChart` report generation, based on the old NCover 1.5.8 style sheet, for both NCover and OpenCover coverage format data
* [BUGFIX] `ConvertTo-NCover` now works on `pwsh`
* `ConvertFrom-NCover` to OpenCover format
### Other
* Updated some consumed NuGet packages but not F# 4.5 (which breaks the `dotnet test` integration) : that's still being worked
* Test cmdlets in WindowsPowerShell in the build, as well as `pwsh`, plus some other refinements to the Pester-based tests

# 3.5.530 (Cerulean series release 3)
* Issue #20 related : `-d|dependency` option for all .net core versions (classic, .dotnet and .global) plus equivalents for pwsh, and MSBuild to allow the user to specify assemblies to satisfy references, anticipating resolution failures
* Issue #20 related : cache resolution failure fix-ups for some possible performance improvement
* Issue #20 related : notify the user of assembly resolution fix-up as a build warning
* minor bugfixes for `ConvertTo-Lcov` and `ConvertTo-Cobertura` for NCover format input
* minor bugfixes for `ConvertTo-XDocument` and `ConvertTo-XmlDocument` to handle XML processing instructions.
* Bugfix -- rework `ConvertTo-NCover` so it actually works on PowerShell Core
* FAKE 5.0 stable now being used
* Cross-platform unit/operational testing with coverage gathering of cmdlets in the build using Pester

# 3.5.518 (Cerulean series release 2)
* [BUGFIX] `ConvertTo-NCover` now also outputs to the object pipeline as well as to the optional file (altcover classic .nupkg)
* [BUGFIX] -- Issue #20 : on assembly resolution failure, look to the nuget package cache for a match (all .nupkg variants)

# 3.5.512 (Cerulean series release 1)
* Separate NuGet packages altcover.dotnet and altcover.global that contain the command-line tool functionality (only) for .net core as a CLI tool and as a .net core global tool respectively 
* [BREAKING] `dotnet test` integration - all names have been prefixed with `AltCover` to avoid collisions
* [BREAKING] `dotnet test` integration - `|` is used as the separator character for lists rather than `;` as the latter causes problems in the command-line context
* Extended the `ConvertTo-Cobertura` and `ConvertTo-Lcov` cmdlets
* `ConvertTo-XDocument` and `ConvertTo-XmlDocument` to interconvert in the object pipeline
* `ConvertTo-NCover` to take OpenCover format to classic NCover

# 3.5.500-pre (Cerulean series pre-release)
* Reduce the amount of unnecessary infrastructure runtime code in the .nupkg that bloated the 3.0.488-490 release
* Expose the LCov and Cobertura output formatters as simple cmdlets `ConvertTo-Cobertura` and `ConvertTo-Lcov` to take OpenCover or NCover format input.
* Minor adjustments to the `Invoke-AltCover` cmdlet based on PowerShell guidelines -- plural argument names made singular with backwards-compatible aliases
---
# 3.0.490 (Caba series release 12 re-spin)
* No functional change from 3.0.488, just removing an experimental extension that couldn't be tested without a release.

# 3.0.488 (Caba series release 12 -- deprecated)
* [Invoke-Altcover cmdlets](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/PowerShell-integration) for both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core
* [coverlet-style `dotnet test` integration](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/%60dotnet-test%60-integration)
* [BUGFIX] -- Possible branch instrumentation failure when filtering is applied.

# 3.0.475 (Caba series release 11)
* Fine tune the speed-up in data collection (marginal improvements only)
* [BUGFIX] -- some corner cases for nested functions (including uses of generics) were not being detected for purposes of exclusion by containing function
* [BUGFIX] -- Issue #17 : restore intended behaviour when no arguments supplied
* [BUGFIX] -- Issue #18 : protect against certain degenerate cases when looking for branch coverage
* other minor build process changes

# 3.0.466 (Caba series release 10)
* Support for starting/pausing/resuming coverage collection during operation -- see https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/Pause%E2%95%B1Resume-and-the-Control-File
* Major speed-up in data collection by reducing the amount of synchronization being done while writing data to file -- this means significant reductions in the time taken for instrumented code to execute 
* Support for excluding C#7.0 local functions by excluding the enclosing method
* Add CRAP (Change Risk Anti-Patterns) score to methods (and min/max values to summaries) in `--opencover` format and `runner`/`Collect` mode 
* [BUGFIX] -- using `dotnet AltCover.dll` to instrument a .net core project using F# could fail when rewriting the `.deps.json` file.
* [BUGFIX] -- not all branches were being tallied for certain complex F# match expressions

# 3.0.455 (Caba series release 9)
* `-o|outputFile` option in `runner` mode (parameter `OutputFile` for the `AltCover.Collect` task) to allow the default report for the current dataset to be written to a new file, rather than updating/accumulating in the file specified at instrumentation time.
* Some refactoring and adjustments to the build processes, latest FAKE RC etc.
* Support for starting/pausing/resuming coverage collection during operation -- see https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/Pause%E2%95%B1Resume-and-the-Control-File
* Add CRAP (Change Risk Anti-Patterns) score to methods (and min/max values to summaries) in `--opencover` format and `runner`/`Collect` mode 
* [BUGFIX] -- handle and signal exceptions in the visit recording, rather than potentially just locking up or silently failing
* [BUGFIX] -- ensure that more of the IDisposable objects generated, primarily the ones that can lock the assemblies under instrumentation, are promptly disposed.
* [BUGFIX] -- using `dotnet AltCover.dll` to instrument a .net core project using F# could fail when rewriting the `.deps.json` file.
* [BUGFIX] -- not all branches were being tallied for certain complex F# match expressions

# 3.0.444 (Caba series release 8)
* [BUGFIX] for `-c|callContext` option -- generate valid IL where the function being tracked completes with a tail call
* [BUGFIX] for `-c|callContext` option -- generate valid IL where the function being tracked contains a branch directly to a return instruction
* `-c|cobertura` option in `runner` mode (parameter `Cobertura` for the `AltCover.Collect` task) -- Cobertura format output to the given file name (more complete for OpenCover format coverage gathering than NCover, inevitably)
* Signal failure explicitly for `-t|threshold` violations, as well as through the return code

# 3.0.433 (Caba series release 7)
* `-t|threshold` option in `runner` mode (parameter `Threshold` for the `AltCover.Collect` task) to fail the build (non-zero return code or MSBuild error state) if coverage falls below the specified percentage
* [BUGFIX] -- Parameters weren't being re-initialised on the second or subsequent use of the MSBuild tasks, leading to failures about arguments being specified more than once (Issue #10)
* [BUGFIX] -- ArgumentNullException when relaying output from a launched process: filter null/empty messages
* FIXED AGAIN : reinstate earlier change [f61f951] to write .mdb out for .mdb in (and pdb out for pdb in) -- at least on .net core and full .net (long story)
* Moving some of the unit tests to XUnit for reasons related to the above

# 3.0.422 (Caba series release 6)
* [BUGFIX] -- Cecil resolves type dependencies by looking relative to the current working directory, no matter where it's actually writing the file : so work in the target directory while we are writing
* Also, just in case, ensure we process files from the depended-upon first, up the dependency chain (assumes no dependency cycles).
* Give feedback of what is written where and when.

# 3.0.416 (Caba series release 5)
* Exclude constructors on compiler generated types as being simply noise -- they will be exercised if you use any of the real code they represent, so nothing of importance is lost
* C# compiler generated types for lambdas, `async`/`await` and `yield return` are mapped to their containing methods for the purpose of filtering by method name or method level attributes
* F# compiler generated types for lambdas, nested named functions and computation expressions are mapped to their containing methods (and their containing methods, if relevant) for the purpose of filtering by method name or method level attributes so that a filter at any level will be picked up by deeply nested inner functions
* Even more feedback on error, including logging exception detail to file.
* [BUGFIX] Mono.Cecil can give `ArgumentException` when given an arbitrary file input (while detecting which files are instrumentable assemblies); handle that case

# 3.0.404 (Caba series release 4)
* Exclusion by attribute on a class also extends to all nested classes, including invisible ones like lambda expressions and relatives.
* Runner mode (and the `AltCover.Collect` task) now outputs coverage summaries (class, method, point and, where available, branch)
* `-l|lcovReport` option in `runner` mode (parameter `LcovReport` for the `AltCover.Collect` task) to also output the result in lcov format

# 3.0.400 (Caba series release 3)
* [BUGFIX] -- malformed filter regexes no longer cause a crash, but are reported as normal errors
* F# auto-properties are now omitted from coverage, just as C# ones are (and have been since before v1.0.101)
* [BUGFIX] -- errors during the instrumentation or collection phases are actually reported
* The main AltCover assembly also now publishes MSBuild tasks `AltCover.Prepare` and `AltCover.Collect`; the former is the normal mode with `--opencover --save --inplace` as default, the latter is `runner` mode with `--collect` as default.  The full parameter lists are
```
InputDirectory
OutputDirectory
SymbolDirectories†
Keys†⁋
StrongNameKey⁋
XmlReport
FileFilter†
AssemblyFilter†
AssemblyExcludeFilter†
TypeFilter†
MethodFilter†
AttributeFilter†
CallContext†
OpenCover‡
InPlace‡
Save‡
CommandLine
```
where these parameters are all optional strings (default empty) except as noted
† = optional array of strings, default empty
‡ = Boolean, default `true`
⁋ = Mono/.net Framework build only

and
```
RecorderDirectory⸸
WorkingDirectory
Executable

CommandLine
```
with all these parameters being optional strings (default empty) except as noted
⸸ denotes a `[Required]` parameter

The task parameters match the command line arguments in name and function, except that `SymbolDirectories` is pluralised, and `CommandLine` is everything after a `--`.  If `AltCover.Collect`'s `Executable` parameter is set, that switches the virtual `--collect` flag off.


# 3.0.388 (Caba series release 2)
* Improved command line error reporting
* `--inplace` option to instrument the assemblies in the input directory, having saved them to the output directory first; this avoids the manual copy-back step for `dotnet test` and the like
* `--save` option in instrumenting mode plus `--collect` in `runner` mode; `--save` sets the instrumented assemblies to record coverage to disk, just as the `runner` mode does; then after doing whatever is required with the instrumented code, `runner --collect` will process the output just as if the operations had been run from within `AltCover runner`.  Note that if `--collect` is set, any arguments after a `-- ` are ignored.

# 3.0.367-pre (Caba series release 1)
* [BREAKING CHANGE] -- packaging the .net core as binaries -- so `dotnet AltCover.dll` rather than `dotnet run altcover.core.fsproj` to invoke.  This will be needed to do the MSBuild integration that's in the pipeline, where it isn't for a simple command-line tool
* [BUGFIX] -- calculate branch exit visit count for `--opencover` (an oversight in 2.0.360)
---
# 2.0.360   (Byakko series release 7)
* Branch coverage for `--opencover`.  Note that AltCover takes a rather more conservative approach to detecting "significant" branch points than does OpenCover : it excludes all branches that are entirely internal to a reported sequence point in the source (thus eliminating the many and various sorts of compiler-surprise hidden branching that may include sequence points with no corresponding source location); additionally, if two or more exits from a branch go to the same place, they are considered to constitute only one branch-point in the report, rather than being counted separately.
* Bonus feature -- `-c|callContext` tracking also applies to branch visits
* Also take the latest VS2017 and FAKE updates for building

# 2.0.354   (Byakko series release 6)
No functional changes this release, just updates of consumed components and tooling
* Take the Cecil 0.10.0 final release, having worked around the issues with unit testing in .net core with NUnit3TestAdapter 3.10, which links the beta6 version, which has a subset of the internal API present in the full release.
* Take the latest VS2017 and FAKE updates for building

# 2.0.350  (Byakko series release 5)
* `-c|callContext` option to track (when collecting the coverage data in "runner" mode) what led to a particular line of code being visited -- either by being called from a method of a specified name or with a specified attribute (unit testing, in the main), or by time of visit (which would be more appropriate for system testing).  Methods (typically, unit tests) may be tracked even if they are in assemblies that are excluded from instrumentation via the `-e`command line parameter.

# 2.0.330  (Byakko series release 4)
* "y|symbolDirectory=" option to provide other locations to find symbols for the instrumented assemblies.  The search order goes -- location in the debug header, co-located (.pdb then .mdb), then supplied locations tested in order for .pdb then .mdb

# 2.0.324  (Byakko series release 3)
* Option `--opencover` now generates values for MethodPoint tags when collecting the coverage data in "runner" mode
* When a process is launched from altcover, the command line is now echoed to stdout
* Build changes : Visual Studio 15.6.1, and latest FAKE 5 beta releases (beta 24); modified the full-framework builds to emit portable .pdb files on Mono, so the travis-ci tests now get coverage for the framework build
* [BUGFIX] altcover.core.fsproj will now build if the Platform is set (previously only `AnyCPU`, explicitly or by default, would work)
* Other x86 related information [added to the wiki](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/x86-support-for-.net-core)

# 2.0.300 (Byakko series release 2)
* [BUGFIX] OpenCover format output now works correctly when classes or methods are filtered out of the coverage
* Option `--opencover` now generates cyclomatic complexity values while generating the report file
* Option `--opencover` now generates roll-up statistics "visitedSequencePoints", "visitedMethods", "visitedClasses", "sequenceCoverage" in Summary tags, and "visited", "sequenceCoverage" in Method tags when collecting the coverage data in "runner" mode

# 2.0.273 (Byakko series release 1)
* Option `--opencover` to output coverage data in a sub-set of the OpenCover format (sufficient for use with ReportGenerator and coveralls.io, at least)
* [BUGFIX] AltCover now exits with the exit code of any process it launches.  In particular if the runner mode is used to launch unit tests, and not all tests pass, then the failure code will be propagated.  Otherwise 0 for success and 255 for any other error.
* Moved to FAKE 5 (`dotnet fake`) for build, and related streamlining of the build scripts
---
# 1.6 (Araiguma respin)
* Remove the last vestiges of the pipe-based solution, some redundant code in the non-runner case that did nothing (but waste cycles) in the RC.

# 1.6-rc (Araiguma respin release candidates)
* Moved to FAKE 5 (classic) for build and related streamlining of the build scripts
* Performance tuning for the coverage gathering (trade off of async+backlog vs strict synchronous gathering) -- observed faster than OpenCover on like-for-like tests
* Fixed an intermittent spin-wait and fail in the unit tests
* Removed obsolete code that catered to Mono.Cecil 0.9.5 limitations

# 1.6-beta (Araiguma respin preview)
* simplified concurrency handling for the data collection.
* reduced size of the intermediate files (to under 5% of the previous sizes for large runs)
* **NOTE** this breaks compatibility between previously instrumented code and the new runner (and vice versa); in general, only same-version components are supported.
* The AltCover.Runner helper program in 1.5 used named pipes, collecting data from the instrumented process as it ran; this was strongly platform dependent and brittle -- and was not compatible in the classic framework with the .net 2 support.
* Named pipes eliminated in favour of writing to a file and post-processing
* Mechanism compatible with .net 2.0 so made available everywhere
* separate .net core only runner program eliminated in favour of an alternate command-line interface for the main AltCover

# 1.5-rc (Araiguma release candidates)
* AltCover.Runner helper program for collecting coverage data for .net core runs, avoiding the need to get everything written out during the ProcessExit handling window.
* various refactorings to support this, but no user-visible changes.

# 1.4-beta (Araiguma preview releases)
* "e|assemblyExcludeFilter=" option to exclude assemblies which depend on instrumented/rewritten ones
* Speed-up in writing out of the instrumentation results which happens in the ProcessExit handling and thus has a limited processing time (mostly affects instrumented code running under `dotnet test`)
* UNFIXED : earlier [f61f951] BUGFIX Write .mdb out for .mdb in -- as Mono.Cecil 0.10 will only write `.pdb` files on .net Framework on Windows, and only `.mdb` anywhere else, including .net core on Windows
* validation of the code on Linux using travis-ci, both using Mono and the full framework, and .net core.  Note that there is an apparent limitation in that F# projects don't generate `.pdb` (or `.mdb`) files under Mono, even when C# projects do, thus they cannot yet be instrumented.
* reorganised directory structure in the .nuget package, with AltCover.exe moving from `tools/` to `tools/net45/` with
* .net core 2.0 support : both the original .net framework build being able to inject instrumentation into `dotnet`-built code, but also a .net core 2.0 tool version (delivered as source to `dotnet run` via the `altcover.core.sln` in `tools/netcoreapp2.0/`) that will also instrument both full-framework and .net core code, with the limitation that this build cannot use strong-naming of assemblies.

# 1.4-alpha (Araiguma preview releases)
* .net 2.0 support : Building the recorder assembly against .net 2.0 so that it can be used with down-version code as required
* Extended filtering : values are extended from being single substring for matching to a semi-colon separated list of regexes; the only backwards incompatibility will be '.' characters which would need to be escaped.

# 1.0
* Expanded user documentation
* Localizable user messages
* More consistent command line parsing
* [f61f951] BUGFIX Write .mdb out for .mdb in
* All times in UTC for consistency
---
# 0.8
Single functional change : redefining the -f parameter to work on source files rather than redundantly on assemblies.
Otherwise, procedural changes only:
* Integrating with real-world publishing e.g. NuGet
* Adding many assertable unit tests to the "if it all hangs together, then it passes" operational tests.
* Fixing the bugs thus revealed

# 0.1
Getting the 2010-11 timescale code from a big blob labelled "projects" and into a stand-alone deployable.
