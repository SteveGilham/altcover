# InvokeAltCoverCommand.CallContext property

Tracking either times of visits in ticks or designated method calls leading to the visits.

A single digit 0-7 gives the number of decimal places of seconds to report; everything else is at the mercy of the system clock information available through DateTime.UtcNow

A string in brackets "[]" is interpreted as an attribute type name (the trailing "Attribute" is optional), so [Test] or [TestAttribute] will match; if the name contains one or more ".", then it will be matched against the full name of the attribute type.

Other strings are interpreted as method names (fully qualified if the string contains any "." characters).

```csharp
public string[] CallContext { get; set; }
```
