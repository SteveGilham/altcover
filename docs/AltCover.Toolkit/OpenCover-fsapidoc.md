## module `OpenCover`
```

  [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
  module OpenCover = begin
    val PostProcess :
      document:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument -> ordinal:BranchOrdinal -> unit
```
Updates summary and related coverage-derived data based on visit counts.  Argument `ordinal` indicates which XML attribute should be used to associate branches with sequence points.
```

    val FormatFromCoverlet :
      report:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument ->
        files:string array -> System.Xml.Linq.XDocument
```
Adds summary data and other items to report in `coverlet`'s OpenCover dialect, particularly giving somewhat meaningful start and end column values for its line-based paradigm, as well as npath coverage and branch exits.  Arguments `files` indicates the assemblies used in the report, which are used to provide sopme of the missing information.
```

    val CompressBranching :
      document:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument ->
        withinSequencePoint:bool -> sameSpan:bool -> System.Xml.Linq.XDocument
```
Takes output from the OpenCover program, and adjust from OpenCover's liberal idea of significant branches towards AltCover's more restricted approach -- chose either or both of `sameSpan` to unify branches that go from the same start, and take the same trajectory to the same end (OpenCover issue #786 being one instance of this) and `withinSequencePoint` to remove branches interior to a statement (compiler generated things like stashing of lambdas, the hidden conditional `Dispose()` after a `using`, or inside F# inlines -- OpenCover issues #657, #807 being instances of this).
```
    val JsonToXml :
      document:string -> System.Xml.Linq.XDocument
```
Takes JSON output from coverlet of AltCover's own native JSON format and converts it to a minimal OpenCover style XML document.
```
