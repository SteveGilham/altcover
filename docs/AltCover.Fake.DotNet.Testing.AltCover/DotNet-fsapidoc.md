Union type defining general command line arguments for `dotnet test` use.
* case `Force` indicates a `/AltCoverForce` value
* case `Fail` indicates a `/AltCoverFailFast` value
* case `Summary` indicates a `/AltCoverShowSummary` value
* case `Many` indicates a collection of cases
* case `Abstract` indicates a collection of cases expressed as an interface

vs

* value `Fast` gives the `/AltCoverFailFast` value this represents
* value `ForceDelete` gives the `/AltCoverForce` value this represents
* value `Summary` gives the `/AltCoverShowSummary` value this represents
