                                   A single digit 0-7 gives the number of
                               decimal places of seconds to report; everything
                               else is at the mercy of the system clock
                               information available through DateTime.UtcNow
                                   A string in brackets "[]" is interpreted as
                               an attribute type name (the trailing "Attribute"
                               is optional), so [Test] or [TestAttribute] will
                               match; if the name contains one or more ".",
                               then it will be matched against the full name of
                               the attribute type.
                                   Other strings are interpreted as method
                               names (fully qualified if the string contains
                               any "." characters).

      --methodpoint          Optional: record only whether a method has been
                               visited or not.  Overrides the --linecover and --
                               branchcover options.
      --all                  Optional: record every hit at any location, and
                               for each context if --callContext is operating.
      --linecover            Optional: Do not record branch coverage.  Ignored

                                   Incompatible with --branchcover.
      --branchcover          Optional: Do not record line coverage.  Ignored
                               for the --reportFormat=NCover option.
                                   Incompatible with --linecover.
      --dropReturnCode       Optional: Do not report any non-zero return code
                               from a launched process.

                               logic implies.
      --showstatic[=VALUE]   Optional: Instrument and show code that is by
                               default skipped as trivial.  --showstatic:- is
                               equivalent to omitting the parameter; --
                               showstatic or --showstatic:+ sets the unvisited
                               count to a negative value interpreted by the
                               visualizer (but treated as zero by
                               ReportGenerator) ; --showstatic:++ sets the
                               unvisited count to zero.

                               warnings as well, three (or more) times to
                               switch off all messages.
      --verbose              Optional, multiple: Verbose mode -- once to switch
                               on detailed messages (or undo one level of -q if
                               any have been set)

                               monitor (including the AltCover.Recorder.g.dll
                               generated by previous a use of the .net core
                               AltCover).
  -w, --workingDirectory=VALUE
                             Optional: The working directory for the
                               application launch
  -x, --executable=VALUE     The executable to run e.g. dotnet
      --collect              Optional: Process previously saved raw coverage

                               statement (S), branch (B) or method (M/AM)
                               coverage percentage (integer, 1 to 100) or
                               maximum acceptable CRAP score (C/AC followed by
                               integer, 1 to 255) e.g. M80C40B50. If the value
                               starts with a number, a leading S is assumed. If
                               any threshold is specified more than once, the
                               last instance is assumed -- so 25S50 counts as
                               S50.
                               Zero/absent values are ignored. If a coverage
                               result is below threshold, or the CRAP score is
                               above threshold, the return code of the process
                               is the largest abs(threshold - actual) rounded
                               up to the nearest integer. AM, AC include
                               methods with no source; the default is to ignore
                               such methods.

                               itself is the same as 'BOC')

### Notes

* If the `--localSource` argument is given, the process checks the first source file path that it finds in the debug symbols for each assembly, and if that file is not found on the current machine, the assembly is treated as if the symbols file did not exist.

* The `--dependency` argument will expand environment variables in the paths from release 4.0.653; %USERPROFILE%, %ProgramFiles% and %NUGET_PACKAGES% are likely to be the most useful here, e.g. `%ProgramFiles%/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App/2.1.5/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cryptography.KeyDerivation.dll` or similar to pick up ASP.Net Core assemblies needed for type references

* The `--callContext` argument has no effect with `NCover` report format.  Tracked methods are recorded at instrumentation time, but call context information is only recorded in runner mode, including `runner --collect`, which allows for heavier processing after the process terminates than the `ProcessExit` handler.

* In runner mode, exactly one of a command to be executed (`-x`) or the `--collect` option is required.  If `--collect` is supplied then anything after a free-standing `--` is ignored.

* In the `runner -x` case, before the executable is launched AltCover creates a file in the same folder as the previously nominated XML report, and while that file is present, the raw coverage data are written there, rather than being held in memory.  After the executable terminates, the data are read and processed into the XML report.  This file is the same one written by `altcover --save`

* Before v6.0 the strong-name key arguments (`-k`, `--sn`) were not available in the .net core build.  At v6.0, AltCover includes a work-around for what was a netstandard1.3 limitation in Mono.Cecil (suitable APIs weren't there), in anticipation of this being included formally in a future Mono.Cecil 0.11 release with netstandard2.0 support.

* Filter values are semi-colon (`;`) separated regular expressions, applied by type in the order as they are defined in the command line; any item whose name matches the expression will be excluded from the coverage reporting.  In the simplest case, with no special regex items, this means that a name containing the filter item as a sub-string will be excluded.  In v6.0.700 or later, should the need ever arise to have a semi-colon in a regex, then escape it in by doubling (`;;`); if a triplet `;;;` or longer is present, doubling gets grouped from the left.

* Except where being driven by AltCover in "runner" mode, coverage statistics are written to the file nominated by the `r|report=` parameter as instrumented assemblies are unloaded from an executing AppDomain, even if this is days or weeks later.  In practice the instrumented assemblies should be deleted after the relevant testing has been run, and the report file will thus be freed up.

* valid arguments for `--teamcity` are `B`, `R`, `+B`, `+R` or nothing at all (same as `B`).  The letter indicates which symbol to use in the TeamCity format for branch coverage (`B` is for `Block`, which by experiment did show in the build report, and `R` is for `bRanch` which is documented, but did not show when I tried it), the optional `+` indicates that the OpenCover summary should also be emitted.

* `ImportModule` will print a string on Mono/non-Windows, but Windows PowerShell won't be there to make use of it.

#### `-e` vs `-s` : what gives?

In the case where you have Unit Tests => Code Under Test => Libraries, and the coverage of the unit tests is not of interest, then exclude those assemblies with `-e`, so their dependencies get rewritten, but their contents are not instrumented or added to the coverage file.  The stable libraries consumed by the code under test (and stable libraries for the unit test framework) should be marked as `-s` to be left untouched.

#### `-p` vs `-f` : what gives?

The distinction is that a single `-p` can exclude a folder `$(SolutionRoot)Generated` (though it has to be specified with manual expansion of the MSBuild variable) and everything in it, while a single `-f` can be used to exclude all `.g.cs` files wherever they are. 

#### `Runner` mode : what gives?

There are three stages to the coverage operation -- instrumenting the code, exercising it, then presenting the results.  Classic `altcover` does the first, and as part of the process, injects the result presentation code into the system under test, to be run when the test process exits (as an exit handler).

This essentially doesn't work with `dotnet test` in .net core (the exit handler doesn't have enough time to work), so the `runner` mode was introduced to wrap the test processing, catching coverage data as it was generated, through a named pipe connection, and then doing the presentation work after the tests completed (release 1.5).  The named pipe implementation proved unreliable as a cross-platform mechanism, so a file-based mechanism was adopted instead (release 1.6) that does work reliably in all places.

With the data being buffered to disk, rather than being stored entirely in memory in one or other process, the `--save` and `runner --collect` options were introduced (release 3.0) to do, respectively, the signalling to the system under test that it should dump live to an intermediate file, and the translation of the intermediate information into the final report, with the testing to be done at some point between, rather than having to run the tests through `altcover runner`.

In release 5.3, the writing the collected data has been offloaded to an in-process data handler, which removes this constraint; the data collector is automatically hooked into the MSBuild process.
