This represents the  command line options and its validation





























### type `CollectOptions`

The members correspond to the like-named command line options for `AltCover Runner`, except
* `ExposeReturnCode` being the converse of the `dropReturnCode` option
* `CommandLine` being the material after a `-- `

```

    type CollectOptions =
      | Primitive of Primitive.CollectOptions
      | TypeSafe of TypeSafe.CollectOptions
      | Abstract of Abstract.ICollectOptions

The property members corresponding to the command line options read the values from the contained instance; null strings will be retrurned as null, but null sequences will be returned as empty ones.

 Values that are not applicable to the use case or platform are silently ignored.

The members correspond to the like-named command line options for `AltCover`, except
* `ExposeReturnCode` being the converse of the `dropReturnCode` option
* `CommandLine` being the material after a `-- `
* `SingleVisit` being the name for `--single`
