# OpenCover.Merge method

Merges OpenCover reports.

Merges OpenCover reports.

Takes a set of OpenCover reports and crates a composite. It handles both strict (`OpenCover`, `AltCover --reportFormat=OpenCover`) and more relaxed (`coverlet`, `ConvertFrom-CoverageJson`, `Write-OpenCoverDerivedState -Coverlet`) interpretations of the format, which may lead to a not-quite strict result. Note -- Module records are merged only if their hash values match, so output from different builds and possibly different source will be kept distinct.

The input reports

```csharp
public static XDocument Merge(IEnumerable<XDocument> documents)
```
