# WriteOpenCoverDerivedStateCommand class

Fills other values based on recorded visit count numbers.

Adds or updates summary data and other computed items in the OpenCover format report.

In `-Coverlet` mode, also fills in some of the gaps left by `coverlet`'s OpenCover dialect, particularly giving somewhat meaningful start and end column values for its line-based paradigm, as well as npath coverage and branch exits.

```csharp
    $xml = Write-OpenCoverComputedValues -InputFile "./_Reports/OpenCoverForPester/OpenCoverForPester.coverlet.xml" -Coverlet -Assembly $Assemblies -OutputFile "./_Packaging/OpenCoverForPester.coverlet.xml"
```

```csharp
    $xml = Write-OpenCoverComputedValues -InputFile "./_Reports/OpenCoverForPester/OpenCoverForPester.xml"
```

```csharp
public class WriteOpenCoverDerivedStateCommand : PSCmdlet
```
