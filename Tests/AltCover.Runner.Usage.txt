  Runner
  -r, --recorderDirectory=VALUE
                             The folder containing the instrumented code to
                               monitor (including the AltCover.Recorder.g.dll
                               generated by previous a use of the .net core
                               AltCover).
  -w, --workingDirectory=VALUE
                             Optional: The working directory for the
                               application launch
  -x, --executable=VALUE     The executable to run e.g. dotnet
      --collect              Optional: Process previously saved raw coverage
                               data, rather than launching a process.
  -l, --lcovReport=VALUE     Optional: File for lcov format version of the
                               collected data
  -t, --threshold=VALUE      Optional: one or more of minimum acceptable
                               statement (S), branch (B) or method (M/AM)
                               coverage percentage (integer, 1 to 100) or
                               maximum acceptable CRAP score (C/AC followed by
                               integer, 1 to 255) e.g. M80C40B50. If the value
                               starts with a number, a leading S is assumed. If
                               any threshold is specified more than once, the
                               last instance is assumed -- so 25S50 counts as
                               S50.
                               Zero/absent values are ignored. If a coverage
                               result is below threshold, or the CRAP score is
                               above threshold, the return code of the process
                               is the largest abs(threshold - actual) rounded
                               up to the nearest integer. AM, AC include
                               methods with no source; the default is to ignore
                               such methods.
  -c, --cobertura=VALUE      Optional: File for Cobertura format version of the
                               collected data
  -o, --outputFile=VALUE     Optional: write the recorded coverage to this file
                               rather than overwriting the original report file.
      --dropReturnCode       Optional: Do not report any non-zero return code
                               from a launched process.
      --summary, --teamcity[=VALUE]
                             Optional: Defines the format of any summary; an
                               optional string value consisting of the tokens :
                               
                               'N' = No summary at all, regardless of other
                               values
                               'B' = TeamCity format, with branches as Block
                               items
                               'R' = TeamCity format, with branches as bRanch
                               items
                               'O' = Classic OpenCover format
                               'C' = Change Risk Anti-Pattern score
                               '+' is the same as "OC" (special case - "+" by
                               itself is the same as 'BOC')
                               If the option is present, but has no value, this
                               is the same as 'B'
                               If the option is not present, then the default
                               is 'OC'.
  -q                         Optional, multiple: Quiet mode -- once to switch
                               off informational messages, twice to switch off
                               warnings as well, three (or more) times to
                               switch off all messages.
  -?, --help, -h             Prints out the options.
