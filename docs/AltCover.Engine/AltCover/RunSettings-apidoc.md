# RunSettings class

Used by the .net core implementation to inject an AltCover data collector, by creating a temporary run-settings file that includes AltCover as well as any user-defined settings.

Not intended for general use, but see the `AltCover.targets` file for how it is used around the test stage.

```csharp
public class RunSettings : Task
```
