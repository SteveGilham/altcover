## module `TypeSafe`
```
  [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
  module TypeSafe = begin
```
This holds the strongly-typed equivalent of the command line options

### Individual files and directories
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type FilePath =
      | Tool of System.String (* a name *)
      | FilePath of System.String (* Expanded to an absolute path *)
      | FInfo of System.IO.FileInfo

      | DirectoryPath of System.String  (* Expanded to an absolute path *)
      | DInfo of System.IO.DirectoryInfo
      | NoDirectory
      with
        member AsString : unit -> string
      end
```
### Test application command line
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type CommandArgument =
      | CommandArgument of System.String
      with
        member AsString : unit -> System.String
      end
    [<NoComparison>]
    type CommandLine =
      | CommandArguments of seq<CommandArgument>
      | NoCommand
      with
        member AsStrings : unit -> seq<System.String>
      end

### Coverage thresholds
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type Thresholds =
      {
        Statements: uint8
        Branches: uint8
        Methods: uint8
        MaxCrap: uint8
        AltMethods : uint8
        AltMaxCrap : uint8
      }
      with
        static member Create : unit -> Thresholds
      end
    [<NoComparison>]
    type Threshold =
      | Threshold of Thresholds
      | NoThreshold
      with
         member AsString : unit -> string
      end
```
### Yes/No choices
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type Flag =
      | Flag of bool (* as the bool *)
      | Set (* true *)
      | Clear (* false *)
      with
        member AsBool : unit -> bool
      end
```
### Multiple files and directories
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type FilePaths =
      | FilePaths of seq<FilePath>
      | NoPaths
      with
        member AsStrings : unit -> System.String list
      end
    [<NoComparison>]
    type DirectoryPaths =
      | DirectoryPaths of seq<DirectoryPath>
      | NoDirectories
      with
        member AsStrings : unit -> System.String list
      end
```
### Selection filters
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type FilterItem =
      | MatchItem of System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex
      | NegateMatchItem of System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex
      | Raw of System.String
      with
        member AsString : unit -> string
      end
    [<NoComparison>]
    type Filters =
      | Filters of seq<FilterItem>
      | Unfiltered
      with
        member Join : filters:FilterItem seq -> Filters
        member AsStrings : unit -> System.String list
      end
```
### Call tracking
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type ContextItem =
      | Caller of System.Reflection.MethodInfo
      | CallerName of System.String
      | AttributeName of System.String
      | AttributeKind of System.Type
      | TimeItem of uint8
      with
        member AsString : unit -> System.String
      end
    [<NoComparison>]
    type Context =
      | Context of seq<ContextItem>
      | NoContext
      with
        member AsStrings : unit -> System.String list
      end
```
### Display formats
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type SummaryFormat =
      | Default (* OpenCover style *)
      | R (* TeamCity bRanch only *)
      | B (* TeamCity Block only *)
      | RPlus (* R + default *)
      | BPlus (* B + default *)
      with
        member AsString : unit -> string
      end
    [<NoComparison>]
    type StaticFormat =
      | Default (* Don't include *)
      | Show (* include with negative visit count if unvisited *)
      | ShowZero (* include with zero visit count if unvisited *)
      with
        member AsString : unit -> string
      end
    [<NoComparison>]
    type ReportFormat =
      | NCover
      | OpenCover
      with
        member AsString : unit -> string
      end
```
### type `CollectOptions`

The members correspond to the like-named command line options for `AltCover Runner`, except
* `ExposeReturnCode` being the converse of the `dropReturnCode` option
* `CommandLine` being the material after a `-- `

```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type CollectOptions =
      {
        RecorderDirectory: DirectoryPath
        WorkingDirectory: DirectoryPath
        Executable: FilePath
        LcovReport: FilePath
        Threshold: Threshold
        Cobertura: FilePath
        OutputFile: FilePath
        CommandLine: CommandLine
        ExposeReturnCode: Flag
        SummaryFormat: SummaryFormat }
      with
        static member Create : unit -> CollectOptions
      end
```
`Create()` returns an instance with all values unset/default except `ExposeReturnCode`, which is `Set.

Fields that are not applicable to the use case or platform are silently ignored.

### type `PrepareOptions`

The members correspond to the like-named command line options for `AltCover`, except
* `ExposeReturnCode` being the converse of the `dropReturnCode` option
* `CommandLine` being the material after a `-- `
* `SingleVisit` being the name for `--single`

```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type PrepareOptions =
      {
        InputDirectories: DirectoryPaths
        OutputDirectories: DirectoryPaths
        SymbolDirectories: DirectoryPaths
        Dependencies: FilePaths
        Keys: FilePaths
        StrongNameKey: FilePath
        XmlReport: FilePath
        FileFilter: Filters
        AssemblyFilter: Filters
        AssemblyExcludeFilter: Filters
        TypeFilter: Filters
        MethodFilter: Filters
        AttributeFilter: Filters
        PathFilter: Filters
        AttributeTopLevel: Filters
        TypeTopLevel: Filters
        MethodTopLevel: Filters
        CallContext: Context
        ReportFormat: ReportFormat
        InPlace: Flag
        Save: Flag
        ZipFile: Flag
        MethodPoint: Flag
        SingleVisit: Flag
        LineCover: Flag
        BranchCover: Flag
        CommandLine: CommandLine
        ExposeReturnCode: Flag
        SourceLink: Flag
        Defer: Flag
        LocalSource: Flag
        VisibleBranches: Flag
        ShowStatic: StaticFormat
        ShowGenerated: Flag }
      with
        static member Create : unit -> PrepareOptions
      end
```
`Create()` returns an instance that has all fields unset/default except `ExposeReturnCode`, `InPlace` and `Save` are `Set`

Fields that are not applicable to the use case or platform are silently ignored.
