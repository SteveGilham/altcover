Both the .net framework/mono and .net core releases publish MSBuild tasks from the main assembly (AltCover.exe or AltCover.dll, respectively) that wrap the command-line functionality (as documented here under [Usage](https:github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/Usage)).

# namespace `AltCover`

For the C# programmer,  attributes have the extran angle-brackets, while `member [Name] : [type] with get, set` is a `[type]` valued property called `[Name]`; and `string array` is just `string[]` spelled out longhand.


For `AltCover.Prepare` and `AltCover.Collect`, the task parameters match the command line arguments in name and function, except that `SymbolDirectories` is pluralised, `SingleVisit` represents the `--single` option, `ExposeReturnCode` is the converse of the command line option `dropReturnCode`, and `CommandLine` is everything after a `--` .  If `AltCover.Collect`'s `Executable` parameter is set, that switches the virtual `--collect` flag off.
```
namespace AltCover
```
## Task `AltCover.Prepare`
This is the instrumentation mode with `--save --inplace --defer` as default.  Associated parameters are
```
type Prepare =
  class
    inherit Task
    new : unit -> Prepare
    override Execute : unit -> bool
    member InputDirectories : string array with get, set
    member OutputDirectories : string array with get, set
    member SymbolDirectories : string array with get, set
    member Dependencies : string array with get, set
    member Keys : string array with get, set
    member StrongNameKey : string with get, set
    member XmlReport : string with get, set
    member FileFilter : string array with get, set
    member AssemblyFilter : string array with get, set
    member AssemblyExcludeFilter : string array with get, set
    member TypeFilter : string array with get, set
    member MethodFilter : string array with get, set
    member AttributeFilter : string array with get, set
    member PathFilter : string array with get, set
    member AttributeTopLevel : string array with get, set
    member TypeTopLevel : string array with get, set
    member MethodTopLevel : string array with get, set
    member CallContext : string array with get, set
    member ReportFormat : string with get, set
    member InPlace : bool with get, set
    member Save : bool with get, set
    member ZipFile : bool with get, set
    member MethodPoint : bool with get, set
    member SingleVisit : bool with get, set
    member LineCover : bool with get, set
    member BranchCover : bool with get, set
    member CommandLine : string array with get, set
    member ExposeReturnCode : bool with get, set
    member SourceLink : bool with get, set
    member Defer : bool with get, set
    member LocalSource : bool with get, set
    member VisibleBranches : bool with get, set
    member ShowStatic : string with get, set
    member ShowGenerated : bool with get, set
  end
```
## Task `AltCover.Collect`
This is `runner` mode with `--collect` as default.  Associated parameters are
```
type Collect =
  class
    inherit Task
    new : unit -> Collect
    override Execute : unit -> bool
    [<Output>]
    member Summary : string
    [<Required>]
    member RecorderDirectory : string with get, set
    member WorkingDirectory : string with get, set
    member Executable : string with get, set
    member LcovReport : string with get, set
    member Threshold : string with get, set
    member Cobertura : string with get, set
    member OutputFile : string with get, set
    member CommandLine : string array with get, set
    member ExposeReturnCode : bool with get, set
    member SummaryFormat : string with get, set
  end
```
## Task `AltCover.PowerShell`
This is the `ImportModule` option; it takes no parameters.
```
type PowerShell =
  class
    inherit Task
    new : unit -> PowerShell
    override Execute : unit -> bool
  end
```
## Task `AltCover.GetVersion`
This is the `Version` option; it takes no parameters.
```
type GetVersion =
  class
    inherit Task
    new : unit -> GetVersion
    override Execute : unit -> bool
  end
```
## Task `AltCover.Echo`
Outputs a possibly coloured string of text to `stdout`.
```
type Echo =
  class
    inherit Task
    new : unit -> Echo
    override Execute : unit -> bool
    member Colour : string with get, set
    [<Required>]
    member Text : string with get, set
  end
```
## Task `AltCover.RunSettings`
Used by the .net core implementation to inject an AltCover data collector, by creating a temporary run-settings file that includes AltCover as well as any user-defined settings.

Not intended for general use, but see the `AltCover.targets` file for how it is used around the test stage.
```
type RunSettings =
  class
    inherit Task
    new : unit -> RunSettings
    override Execute : unit -> bool
    [<Output>]
    member Extended : string with get, set
    member TestSetting : string with get, set
  end
```
