# namespace `AltCover`
```
namespace AltCover
```






## module `AltCover`

```
  [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
  module AltCover = begin
```
This represents the  command line options and its validation

### type `ValidatedCommandLine`
```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type ValidatedCommandLine =
      {
        Command: string list
        Errors: seq<string> }
      with
        override ToString : unit -> string
      end
```
Holds the composed command line in `Command`, and any validation errors in `Errors`.

The `ToString()` override formats the outcome for pretty-printing

### type `CollectOptions`

The members correspond to the like-named command line options for `AltCover Runner`, except
* `ExposeReturnCode` being the converse of the `dropReturnCode` option
* `CommandLine` being the material after a `-- `

```
    [<NoComparison>]
    type CollectOptions =
      | Primitive of Primitive.CollectOptions
      | TypeSafe of TypeSafe.CollectOptions
      | Abstract of Abstract.ICollectOptions
      with
        interface Abstract.ICollectOptions
        member RecorderDirectory : System.String

        member WorkingDirectory : System.String
        member Executable : System.String
        member LcovReport : System.String
        member Threshold : System.String
        member Cobertura : System.String
        member OutputFile : System.String
        member CommandLine : seq<string>
        member ExposeReturnCode : bool
        member SummaryFormat : System.String
```

```
        member Validate : afterPreparation:bool -> string []
      end
```
`Validate` does simple checking of the arguments without causing any changes to the system; set the input argument `true` if the Prepare step has already run (and there should be instrumented code the `RecorderDirectory`; returns all the problems that the application command-line could report, so empty is success.







The property members corresponding to the command line options read the values from the contained instance; null strings will be retrurned as null, but null sequences will be returned as empty ones.

 Values that are not applicable to the use case or platform are silently ignored.
### type `PrepareOptions`

The members correspond to the like-named command line options for `AltCover`, except
* `ExposeReturnCode` being the converse of the `dropReturnCode` option
* `CommandLine` being the material after a `-- `
* `SingleVisit` being the name for `--single`

```
        member Validate : unit -> string []
      end
```
`Validate` does simple checking of the arguments without causing any changes to the system; returns all the problems that the application command-line could report, so empty is success.







The property members corresponding to the command line options read the values from the contained instance; null strings will be retrurned as null, but null sequences will be returned as empty ones.

 Values that are not applicable to the use case or platform are silently ignored.

### type `LoggingOptions`

Destinations for user level output at various levels of success.  `Echo` is for the
command line and usage warninings only.

```
    type LoggingOptions =
      | Primitive of Primitive.LoggingOptions
      | Abstract of Abstract.ILoggingOptions
      with
        member Info : (System.String -> unit)
        member Warn : (System.String -> unit)
        member Error : (System.String -> unit)
        member Echo : (System.String -> unit)
        static member
          ActionAdapter : action:System.Action<System.String> ->
                            (System.String -> unit)
        static member Create : unit -> LoggingOptions
        static member Translate : options:Abstract.ILoggingOptions -> LoggingOptions
      end
```
 Of the static methods, `Create()` returns a pure sink instance; while `ActionAdapter` and `Translate` are helpers for C# use.
The instance methods return the corresponding value from the underlying structure, translating `Failure` to `Error` (not a keyword in F#)
