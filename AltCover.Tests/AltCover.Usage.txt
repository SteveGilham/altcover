                                   A single digit 0-7 gives the number of
                               decimal places of seconds to report; everything
                               else is at the mercy of the system clock

                               an attribute type name (the trailing "Attribute"
                               is optional), so [Test] or [TestAttribute] will
                               match; if the name contains one or more ".",
                               then it will be matched against the full name of
                               the attribute type.
                                   Other strings are interpreted as method
                               names (fully qualified if the string contains

      --branchcover          Optional: Do not record line coverage.  Implies,
                               and is compatible with, the --reportFormat=
                               opencover option.

                               details in switch/match constructs, and just

      --showstatic[=VALUE]   Optional: Instrument and show code that is by
                               default skipped as trivial.  --showstatic:- is

                               showstatic or --showstatic:+ sets the unvisited
                               count to a negative value interpreted by the
                               visualizer (but treated as zero by
                               ReportGenerator) ; --showstatic:++ sets the
                               unvisited count to zero.
      --showGenerated        Mark generated code with a visit count of -2 (
                               Automatic) for the Visualizer if unvisited

                               off informational messages, twice to switch off

                               switch off all messages.
  -?, --help, -h             Prints out the options.
