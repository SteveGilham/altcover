This represents the weakly ("stringly") typed equivalent of the command line options in a C# friendly manner
as interfaces with the values expressed as read-only properties.

### interface `ICollectOptions`

The members correspond to the like-named command line options for `AltCover Runner`, except
* `ExposeReturnCode` being the converse of the `dropReturnCode` option
* `CommandLine` being the material after a `-- `

```
  type ICollectOptions =
    interface
    abstract member RecorderDirectory : String with get
    abstract member WorkingDirectory : String with get
    abstract member Executable : String with get
    abstract member LcovReport : String with get
    abstract member Threshold : String with get
    abstract member Cobertura : String with get
    abstract member OutputFile : String with get
    abstract member CommandLine : IEnumerable<String> with get
    abstract member ExposeReturnCode : bool with get
    abstract member SummaryFormat : String with get
  end
```
### interface `IPrepareOptions`

The members correspond to the like-named command line options for `AltCover`, except
* `ExposeReturnCode` being the converse of the `dropReturnCode` option
* `CommandLine` being the material after a `-- `
* `SingleVisit` being the name for `--single`
