# MergeOpenCoverCommand class

Merges OpenCover reports.

Takes a set of OpenCover reports and crates a composite. It handles both strict (`OpenCover`, `AltCover --reportFormat=OpenCover`) and more relaxed (`coverlet`, `ConvertFrom-CoverageJson`, `Write-OpenCoverDerivedState -Coverlet`) interpretations of the format, which may lead to a not-quite strict result. Note -- Module records are merged only if their hash values match, so output from different builds and possibly different source will be kept distinct.

```csharp
    $xml = $docs | Merge-OpenCover -OutputFile "./_Packaging/Combined.xml"
```

```csharp
public class MergeOpenCoverCommand : PSCmdlet
```
